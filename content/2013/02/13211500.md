Previously, I introduced how to
"[Use Travis CI for Vim plugin development](/2013/02/08211255)".
CI requires well-developed test suites to achieve advantages.
But I did not describe much about how to write unit tests
for Vim plugin development in the article.
If you try to write unit tests for a Vim plugin,
you will be faced with problems like the following:

* Run a Vim process without any customization to reproduce same results.
  For example, plugins installed by users should not be loaded
  even if unit tests try to load them by `:runtime! plugin/**/*.vim`
  or other ways.
* Resolve dependencies of a plugin to be tested.
  It requires to fetch proper versions of dependencies
  and to make them available for a Vim process to run unit tests.

It is hard to resolve each problem.  So that there are many frameworks
for unit testing.  But all of them have one or more problems as follows:

* Runtime environment is not considered well for reproducibility.
* It is hard to automate run unit tests for CI or other usage.
* It is not easy to read and to write unit tests.

Therefore I wrote another framework to resolve all problems.
It is called [vim-vspec](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec).
Though I wrote it 4 years ago, I did not talk much about it.
Because the ecosystem including vim-vspec was not mature.
But now the ecosystem has been mature and ready to use anyone.
So let me describe how I write unit tests for Vim plugin development.




### Requirements

* Follow the step 1 to 4 in
  "[Use Travis CI for Vim plugin development](/2013/02/08211255)".
* Install vim-vspec.
  * As described later, vim-vspec introduces a custom syntax for Vim
    script to write readable unit tests.  vim-vspec includes additional
    configuration for syntax highlighting and automatic indentation for
    the custom syntax.  So that it is recommended to install vim-vspec
    for the configuration.  But you may choose not to install vim-vspec,
    because it is automatically downloaded to run unit tests,




### The structure of directories

* Create a directory called `t`.
* Save test scripts into the `t` directory with extension `.vim`.




### The structure of a test script

It often requires to describe detailed operations on Vim to test a Vim
plugin.  So that the best language to write unit tests for Vim plugins
is --- Vim script.  (Note that the ecosystem allows writing tests in an
arbitrary language, but it is not necessary in most cases.)

The structure of a test script is similar to [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).
In short,

* Write a [`describe`](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec/blob/1.1.0/doc/vspec.txt#L84) block
  for each target to be tested.
* Write an [`it`](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec/blob/1.1.0/doc/vspec.txt#L89) block
  into a `describe` block for each behavior to be tested.
* Write expectations about behavior into an `it` block.

For example:

```vim
describe 'math#round_to_zero'
  it 'returns 0 as is'
    Expect math#round_to_zero(0) == 0
  end

  it 'returns a floor of a positive number'
    Expect math#round_to_zero(0.1) == 0
    Expect math#round_to_zero(1) == 1
    Expect math#round_to_zero(1.23) == 1
    Expect math#round_to_zero(123.456) == 123
  end

  it 'returns a ceiling of a negative number'
    Expect math#round_to_zero(-0.1) == 0
    Expect math#round_to_zero(-1) == -1
    Expect math#round_to_zero(-1.23) == -1
    Expect math#round_to_zero(-123.456) == -123
  end
end
```




### How to write expectations

To compare actual results with expected results, use
[`Expect`](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec/blob/1.1.0/doc/vspec.txt#L104).
For example:

```vim
Expect foo#bar#baz() == 'qux'
```

* Write an expression to get an actual result into the left side.
* Write an expression for an expected result into the right side.
* [All comparison operators of Vim
  script](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/eval.html#expr4) are available.
  Comparison operators in this context are called "matchers".
* An expectation is passed when its actual value is matched to its
  expected value.  Otherwise an expectation is failed.
* You may write like `Expect X not == Y` to inverse the meaning of
  a matcher.
* You may [add your own
  mathcers](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec/blob/1.1.0/doc/vspec.txt#L134) to
  improve readability of expectations.




### How to run unit tests

It is fairly simple; just run `rake test`.
You will see results of unit tests like the following:

```
$ rake test
bundle exec vim-flavor test
-------- Preparing dependencies
Checking versions...
  Use kana/vim-textobj-user ... 0.3.12
  Use kana/vim-vspec ... 1.1.0
Deploying plugins...
  kana/vim-textobj-user 0.3.12 ... skipped (already deployed)
  kana/vim-vspec 1.1.0 ... skipped (already deployed)
Completed.
-------- Testing a Vim plugin
Files=0, Tests=0,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.11 sys =  0.11 CPU)
Result: NOTESTS
t/c.vim .... ok
t/vim.vim .. ok
All tests successful.
Files=2, Tests=12,  2 wallclock secs ( 0.08 usr  0.72 sys +  0.21 cusr  0.97 csys =  1.98 CPU)
Result: PASS
```

If one or more unit tests are failed, you will see results like the
following:

```
$ rake test
bundle exec vim-flavor test
-------- Preparing dependencies
Checking versions...
  Use kana/vim-textobj-user ... 0.3.12
  Use kana/vim-vspec ... 1.1.0
Deploying plugins...
  kana/vim-textobj-user 0.3.12 ... skipped (already deployed)
  kana/vim-vspec 1.1.0 ... skipped (already deployed)
Completed.
-------- Testing a Vim plugin
Files=0, Tests=0,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.00 CPU)
Result: NOTESTS
t/c.vim .... 1/?
not ok 1 - <Plug>(textobj-function-a) selects the next function if there is no function under the cursor
# Expected line("'<") == 3
#       Actual value: 2
#     Expected value: 3
t/c.vim .... Failed 1/6 subtests
t/vim.vim .. ok

Test Summary Report
-------------------

  Failed test:  1
Files=2, Tests=12,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.03 usr  0.02 sys +  0.11 cusr  0.06 csys =  0.22 CPU)
Result: FAIL

```

Note that actual output is colored.




### Simplify common initializations and/or finalizations

Suppose that you define a new operator to edit text.
To test its behavior, it is necessary to

* Set up a new buffer with sample text before running a test case, and
* Discard the buffer after running a test case.

Such initializations and finalizations can be simplified with
[`before`/`after`](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec/blob/1.1.0/doc/vspec.txt#L179).
`before` block will be executed before running each `it` block, and
`after` block will be executed after running each `it` block.
For example:

```vim
describe '...'
  before
    new
    put =[
    \   'foo',
    \   'bar',
    \   'baz',
    \   '...',
    \ ]
  end

  after
    close!
  end

  it '...'
    ...
  end

  it '...'
    ...
  end
end
```




### Mark tests as "not implemented yet"

It takes a long time to write complete unit tests.
So that it is common to

* List targets or use cases to be tested, but
* Defer writing the contents of the tests.

To indicate such "not implemented yet" tests, use
[`TODO`](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec/blob/1.1.0/doc/vspec.txt#L213)
as follows:

```vim
it '...'
  TODO
end
```

`TODO` tests are always treated as failed ones, and they are highlighted
like the following:

```
$ rake test
...
-------- Testing a Vim plugin
Files=0, Tests=0,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.04 sys =  0.04 CPU)
Result: NOTESTS
t/c.vim .... 1/?
not ok 1 - # TODO <Plug>(textobj-function-a) selects the next function if there is no function under the cursor
t/c.vim .... ok
t/vim.vim .. ok
All tests successful.
Files=2, Tests=12,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.05 usr  0.46 sys +  0.13 cusr  0.40 csys =  1.04 CPU)
Result: PASS
```




### Skip tests for a specific environment

Sometimes you have to write tests for a specific environment.
Such tests should be skipped for other environments.
You can use
[`SKIP`](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec/blob/1.1.0/doc/vspec.txt#L217)
to indicate such tests:

```vim
it '...'
  if executable('git') < 1
    SKIP 'Git is not available.'
  endif

  ...
end
```

`SKIP` tests are always treated as passed ones, and they are highlighted
like the following:

```
$ rake test
...
-------- Testing a Vim plugin
Files=0, Tests=0,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.00 CPU)
Result: NOTESTS
t/c.vim .... 1/?
ok 1 - # SKIP <Plug>(textobj-function-a) selects the next function if there is no function under the cursor - 'Git is not available.'
t/c.vim .... ok
t/vim.vim .. ok
All tests successful.
Files=2, Tests=12,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.03 usr  0.01 sys +  0.08 cusr  0.02 csys =  0.14 CPU)
Result: PASS
```

* [Call script-local functions and read/write script-local variables](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec/blob/1.1.0/t/tools.vim)
* [Write unit tests in an arbitrary language](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec/blob/1.1.0/t/error-in-it.t)
