[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
provides a hosted continuous integration (CI) service
for the open source community.
It is integrated with GitHub and supports various languages.
Since Travis CI is flexible,
it is not difficult to use Travis CI for projects written in languages
for which Travis CI does not offer first class support.
So that it is possible to *introduce CI for Vim plugins*.

But there are problems to start CI for Vim plugins.  For example:

* How do I write tests for Vim plugins?
* How do I run tests in a clean environment?
* How do I resolve dependencies for Vim plugins to run tests?

Fortunately, there is a toolchain to solve the above problems.
The toolchain consists of two parts;
[vim-vspec](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec) and
[vim-flavor](https://github.com/kana/vim-flavor).
So that it is easy to start CI for Vim plugins with the following steps.




### 1. Install the toolchain to run tests

Write [a `Gemfile` to install the
toolchain](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-function/commit/94a010eebbb4a2f099a895088a4e0c292f6481a9),
then commit it:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'vim-flavor', '~> 1.1'
```

Then run `bundle install` to install the toolchain.




### 2. Write a script to automate testing

Write [a `Rakefile` to automate
testing](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-function/commit/2eddf9248533f52a81e70d5870d44c6daf246a2a),
then commit it:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env rake

task :ci => [:dump, :test]

task :dump do
  sh 'vim --version'
end

task :test do
  sh 'bundle exec vim-flavor test'
end
```

Now you can run tests with `rake test`.

Note that tasks except `test` are to output extra information
for tests run on Travis CI.




### 3. Write a configuration to run tests on Travis CI

Write [a `.travis.yml` to configure how to run tests on Travis
CI](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-function/commit/bae4475f6a1d8c202957eed4972ff7a02b973277),
then commit it:

```yaml
language: ruby
rvm:
  - 1.9.3
script: rake ci
```




### 4. Declare dependencies of a Vim plugin to be tested

(You may skip this step if a target Vim plugin does not require any other plugins.)

Some Vim plugins require other plugins.
For example,
[vim-textobj-function](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-function)
provides text objects to edit text by a function.
It is not easy to implement text objects because of many edge cases.
So that vim-textobj-function uses
[vim-textobj-user](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user)
to hide such details.

And dependencies can be complex.  For example,

* Plugin A 1.0.0 requires plugin B 2.2 or later.
* Plugin A 3.0.0 requires plugin B 4.4 or later.
* But plugin B 2.x and 4.x are incompatible;
  so that "2.2 or later" implies "2.2 or later versions compatible with 2.x".

It is hard to maintain such dependencies and compatibility problems by hand.
But vim-flavor automates complex tasks.
All you have to do is to write
[a `VimFlavor` to declare dependencies of a Vim
plugin](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-function/commit/7eb21828a0db386d576a045c36b1fb456532ec7e).
For example, vim-textobj-function requires vim-textobj-user 0.3 or later (except 1.x or later).
Such a dependency is declared as follows:

```ruby
flavor 'kana/vim-textobj-user', '~> 0.3'
```

[the document about dependency declaration of a Vim plugin](https://www.relishapp.com/kana/vim-flavor/docs/flavorfile).




### 5. Write tests for a Vim plugin

Vim plugins are run on Vim.
Tests for Vim plugins often require to specify complex operations of Vim.
So that the best language to write tests for Vim plugins is --- Vim script.

So,

* Create a directory called `t`.
* Write test scripts in [the vim-vspec format](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec/blob/master/doc/vspec.txt).
* Save test scripts into the `t` directory.  Each script name must be end with `.vim`.

With vim-vspec, you can write tests like [RSpec](http://rspec.info/):

```vim
describe 'math#round_to_zero'
  it 'returns a floor for a positive number'
    Expect math#round_to_zero(1.2) == 1
    Expect math#round_to_zero(34.5) == 34
  end
end
```

[tests for vim-vspec](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec/tree/master/t) for real world examples.




### 6. Push the above changes to your GitHub repository




### 7. Brew a cup of coffee, then wait for a while...




### 8. Enjoy results of tests on Travis CI

Example:
