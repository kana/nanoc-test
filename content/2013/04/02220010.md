On April 10, 2013,
"[開発ツール徹底攻略](http://amzn.to/YB7iNt)"
(lit. The Definitive Guide to Development Tools),
the latest book from
[WEB+DB PRESS plus series](http://gihyo.jp/magazine/wdpress/plus)
will be released.
The book is a collection of excellent articles which were contributed to
[WEB+DB PRESS](http://gihyo.jp/magazine/wdpress),
one of the most famous tech magazines in Japan.
Each article is a great guide to use important tools for software development,
such as Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Vim, Emacs, and Linux.

And I contributed an article to the book.
The title is "Vimの流儀" (lit. The Style of Vim).
It's a whirlwind guide to master Vim.
It covers various topics, for example:

* How to effectively edit text with the standard features,
  such as operators, text objects, completion, and more.
* How to customize various aspects of Vim,
  such as key bindings, Ex commands, filetype-specific settings.
* How to boost productivity with useful plugins.
* How to write and to share your own plugins.

Originally the article was contributed to
[WEB+DB PRESS Vol.52](http://amzn.to/14xEVku), released on August 2009.
It's still an effective guide to master Vim,
because I wrote only essential aspects on Vim for the article.
But a few parts are getting obsolete due to the latest trend.
So that I revised such parts,
and the book contains a revised version of the article.
